      Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be
      called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
      female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a
      pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
      their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
      cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
      domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.

      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,<sup>[2]</sup> up from more
      than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any
      other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth,
      folklore and religion, and in language and literatureGenetic studies have
      pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, and East Asia,<sup

    <p>
      In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term
      for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook" or "she keeps chooks"); which
      enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or
      recently hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is
      mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz. the young of any bird.

    <!--Making a Heading2-->
    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual connotation of the original English cock, and is widely used
      throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to
      sleep at night.
